This package provides the caculation of the differential cross-sections for 
ZZ->4l final state for the ee/mm currently. 

To run the scripts you need to follow the instructions as below:

1. Check out and complile code in CMSSW area, current code tested only on CMSSW_4_2_3

cmsrel CMSSW_4_2_3
cd CMSSW_4_2_3/src/
cmsenv
cvs co -d HZZ4lME UserCode/YGao/HZZ4lME
cvs co -d Higgs/Higgs_CS_and_Width UserCode/Snowball/Higgs/Higgs_CS_and_Width
cp -r Higgs/Higgs_CS_and_Width/txtFiles .
cd HZZ4lME/
cp /afs/cern.ch/user/y/yygao/public/libmcfm.so .
make

** Note this pre-made libmcfm.so is extracted from the MCFM62 version by doing this,
1). Get and install the MCFM package
wget http://mcfm.fnal.gov/mcfm-6.2.tar.gz
tar -zxf mcfm-6.2.tar.gz
cd MCFM
./Install
2). Edit the compiler flags for both g++ and f90 in the makefile
The PIC flag must be added to allow the shared library to be built
The following lines are identical to those in the default makefile, except for the addition of the PIC flag
FFLAGS  = -fno-automatic -fno-f2c -O0 -g -fPIC -I$(INCPATH) -Iobj
F90FLAGS = -fno-automatic -fno-f2c -O2 -g -fPIC -I$(INCPATH) -Iobj -Jobj
3) compile the library
make
cd obj
g++ -Wl,-soname,libmcfm.so -shared -o libmcfm.so *.o 


2. Run the script based on the 

lxplus.cern.ch:~whitbeck/public/LO_data_BKG_eemm.root 
lxplus.cern.ch:~whitbeck/public/LO_data_SIG_eemm.root 

root -l
.L runME_HZZ4l.C++
runME_HZZ4l("./","LO_data_BKG_eemm.root","./",1000000,0)

3. The output is the same file with _ME.root, it contains the branch called "dXsec" which is the 
event-by-event differential cross-section
